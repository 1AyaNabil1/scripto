**Scripto** is a full-stack application designed to transform written stories into visual storyboards. It leverages generative AI to create scene descriptions, dialogue, and corresponding images, providing a seamless experience for writers, filmmakers, and creators.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Storyboard Generation**: Automatically creates detailed storyboards from a simple story plot.
- **Rich Scene Detail**: Generates scene descriptions, dialogue, and action notes.
- **Visual Style Customization**: Allows users to define the genre, mood, and visual style (e.g., Cinematic, Anime, Noir).
- **Image Generation**: Utilizes a DALL-E model to generate a unique image for each scene in the storyboard.
- **Web-Based Interface**: An intuitive and responsive user interface for submitting stories and viewing the final storyboard.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Built with a scalable and efficient serverless backend using Azure Functions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Azure Functions
- **AI Models**:
  - A GPT-based model for text and storyboard generation.
  - A DALL-E-based model for image generation.

## Project Structure

The application is structured as a monorepo with two main components:

```
/
├── frontend/      # React/TypeScript UI
└── backend/       # Node.js Azure Functions API
```

For detailed information about each component, please refer to their respective README files:

- [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md)
- [Backend README](./backend/README.md)
